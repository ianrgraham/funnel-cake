# funnel-cake todo

* Make OOP API for softness
    * Dataclass or pyo3 class
    * JSON serializable configuration file
        * Optionally, include post-training metadata 
    * Zirello-Frankel structure functions by default (radial)
        * If using pyo3, enums in the backend control which implementation is used
        * radial, radial + angular, other
        * gaussian smear, triangular
        * logarithmic binning
* Implement a couple GNN models
    * Start playing around with data more
    * Work on descriptors

* Generalized softness ideas
    * Allow arbitrary MPN applied to each radial feature (concatenated with potential)
        * Maybe also the radii we are looking at (possibly 1-hot)
        * In this case we only have one MPN that is supposed to learn the entire multiparam function
